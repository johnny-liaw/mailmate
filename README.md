# Background
MailMate is a Trello-like email client to help you manage your growing inbox! Users can interact with their email exactly like they would a normal Trello board. Want to move an email to the Urgent list so you can do it later? No worries, just drag it to the Urgent column, it's as easy as that.

# Does it connect with Gmail?
Yes, it connects to the Google Gmail API. Moving an email from one swimlane to another would be the equivalent of giving that email a specific label. You can also send and receive emails like you would a normal email client.
